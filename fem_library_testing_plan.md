# FEM Library Testing Plan

## Objective
Test mainstream open-source FEM libraries for installation capability and effective calculation of continuous beam bridge support reactions.

## Test Criteria
1. **Installation Success**: Can the library be installed without errors?
2. **Basic Functionality**: Can it perform simple structural calculations?
3. **Bridge Analysis Capability**: Can it analyze continuous beam bridges and calculate support reactions?
4. **Documentation Quality**: Are there sufficient examples and documentation?
5. **Community Support**: Are there active forums/communities for troubleshooting?

## Test Bridge Configuration
- **Structure**: 3-span continuous beam (20m + 25m + 20m)
- **Cross-section**: Box beam (simplified as rectangular)
- **Material**: Concrete (E = 30 GPa)
- **Loads**: 
  - Dead load: 25 kN/m
  - Live load: 10 kN/m
  - Point load: 100 kN at mid-span of center span

## Expected Results
- **Support Reactions**: R1, R2, R3, R4 (4 supports for 3 spans)
- **Validation**: Compare against theoretical continuous beam analysis

## Testing Schedule
1. **Phase 1**: Easy installations (Python pip packages)
2. **Phase 2**: Medium difficulty (system packages)
3. **Phase 3**: Hard installations (compile from source)
4. **Phase 4**: Alternative solutions research if standard methods fail

## Success Metrics
- **Green**: Installs easily, calculates correctly, good documentation
- **Yellow**: Installs with minor issues, basic functionality works
- **Red**: Installation fails or major functionality issues

## Community Resources for Troubleshooting
- Reddit: r/engineering, r/civilengineering, r/Python
- FreeCAD Forum: https://forum.freecad.org/
- Stack Overflow
- GitHub Issues for each project
- Academic papers and tutorials

## Fallback Strategy
If primary methods fail:
1. Try Docker containers
2. Try virtual machines with different OS
3. Try cloud-based solutions (Google Colab, etc.)
4. Research alternative compilation methods
5. Contact library maintainers directly
